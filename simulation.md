# 📌 Overview
This project presents a comparative design and performance analysis of two widely used Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) architectures:

Class AB OTA – Known for high slew rate and rail-to-rail swing.

Folded Cascode OTA – Favored for its high gain and low noise.

Implemented using TSMC 180nm CMOS technology, this study evaluates key analog performance parameters to guide design trade-offs for specific application needs.
